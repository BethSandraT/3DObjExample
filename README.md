# Project 2: Rotating a 3D Scene

Hey Coffee, so the bug (feature?) I'm experiencing is this weird clipping in the scene when objects get too far. I suspect this has to do with the depth test, but I have no clue how to modify that part. Currently should display a kettle and a teacup, with three sliders rotating them along the x, y, and z axes. The code is largely cobbled together from in-class examples, so let me know if I need to explain any of them.

Also let me know if the code even works lol. I tried to get all the dependencies here in this repo or linked to a public repo, but I could have overlooked something.
